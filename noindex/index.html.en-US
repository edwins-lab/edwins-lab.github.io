      <h1>Test Page</h1>
      <p class="lead">This page is used to test the proper operation of the <a href="http://apache.org">Apache HTTP server</a> after it has been installed. If you can read this page it means that this site is working properly. This server is powered by <a href="http://centos.org">CentOS</a>.</p>

          <h2>Just visiting?</h2>
			  	<p class="lead">The website you just visited is either experiencing problems or is undergoing routine maintenance.</p>
          <p>If you would like to let the administrators of this website know that you've seen this page instead of the page you expected, you should send them e-mail. In general, mail sent to the name "webmaster" and directed to the website's domain should reach the appropriate person.</p>
          <p>For example, if you experienced problems while visiting www.example.com, you should send e-mail to "webmaster@example.com".</p>
        <h2>Important note:</h2>
        <p class="lead">The CentOS Project has nothing to do with this website or its content, it just provides the software that makes the website run.</p>
        <p>If you have issues with the content of this site, contact the owner of the domain, not the CentOS project. Unless you intended to visit CentOS.org, the CentOS Project does not have anything to do with this website, the content or the lack of it.</p>
        <p>For example, if this website is www.example.com, you would find the owner of the example.com domain at the following WHOIS server: <a href="http://www.internic.net/whois.html">http://www.internic.net/whois.html</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h2>Are you the Administrator?</h2>
          <p>You should add your website content to the directory <code>/var/www/html/</code>.</p>
          <p>To prevent this page from ever being used, follow the instructions in the file <code>/etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf</code>.</p>

          <p>The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable and reproduceable platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).</p>
          <p>Additionally to being a popular choice for web hosting, CentOS also provides a rich platform for open source communities to build upon. For more information please visit the <a href="http://www.centos.org/">CentOS website</a>.</p>
